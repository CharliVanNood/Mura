dependencies:

pygame==2.6.1
pillow==11.2.1

<br/><br/>
How to install game:

<br/><br/>
How to install dependencies:

pip install -r reqirements.txt
<br/><br/>

How to run the game:
run main.py and the game window will open

# controls:


A: move left

D: move right


Space: jump

**X**: respawn / quit

&uarr; : change gravity up

&darr; : change gravity down


# Formatting world files:
## Default
All objects should start with the object id,  
The arguments are split by : and ended with @
## Player
For the player object you have to give up the P at the start to notify the engine it's dealing with a player  
And after that the x and y coordinates which will result in an object like this:  
`P:1:2@`
This will set the player to x=1 and y=2  
## Portal
For the portal object you have to give up the T at the start to notify the engine it's dealing with a player  
And after that the x and y coordinates which will result in an object like this:  
`T:1:2`
This will set the portal to x=1 and y=2, T stands for teleport as P was already used in player  
`T:1:2:10:10@`
This second set of x and y arguments sets the destination
## Ground
For the ground object you have to give up the GroundId at the start to notify the engine it's dealing with a ground object  
We have a few different ground objects, the main ones right now are:  
- G1: ground_1
- GW1: ground_wide_1
And after that the x and y coordinates which will result give an unfinished object like this:
`G1:1:2`
This will set the ground to x=1 and y=2, now we have to set the size modifier like this:
`G1:1:2:1:1`
1 by 1 is the normal size for a ground object, making this 2 will double it's size, and at last we have to set the extenders like this:
`G1:1:2:1:1:ED@`
This will extend the tile down, the tags for this are:  
- ED: Extends Down
- EU: Extends Up
- N: No extenders
